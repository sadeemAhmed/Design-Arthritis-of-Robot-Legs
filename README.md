## Project Description📝


## Technologies Used 🔧
- **Maxon Cinema 4D**: A powerful 3D modeling, animation, and rendering application used for creating the robot leg design.

## Steps to Complete 🗺️

1. **Create an Account in Maxon**:
    - Go to the Maxon website and create a new account.

   

2. **Download Cinema 4D**:
    - After creating your account, download Cinema 4D from the Maxon website.

   

3. **Create a New Project**:
    - Open Cinema 4D and create a new project named `task1.c4d`.

   

4. **Begin Designing the Arthritis Mechanism**:
    - Use the tools and features in Cinema 4D to start designing the arthritis of robot legs.

    

5. **Use Leg Structure**:
    - In Cinema 4D, go to `Character > Skinning > Joint` to add joints to the leg structure.
    - Add four main joints: `Foot`, `Ankle`, `Knee`, and `Thigh`.

    

6. **Add Plane Tool to Set as Floor**:
    - Use the Plane tool to create a floor at a 0-degree angle and name it `guide`. This will act as the ground for your robot leg design.

   

7. **Add "Logo Screen" and "Lighting" Folders**:
    - Create a folder named `logo screen` that contains an `RS camera`.
    - Create a folder named `lighting` that contains an `RS dome light`.

    

8. **Add Null Object in Each Leg**:
    - Add a null object to each leg, labeling them as `Right` and `Left`.

   

9. **Add IK-Spline to Each Joint**:
    - Add the tool named `IK-spline` to each joint to improve the movement of each leg.
