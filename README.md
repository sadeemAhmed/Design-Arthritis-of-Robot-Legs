## Project Description📝
The "Design Arthritis of Robot Legs" project is a comprehensive exercise in simulating the mechanical structure and movement of robotic legs affected by arthritis using Cinema 4D. Arthritis in robotics refers to the introduction of mechanical constraints and wear that simulate the effects of arthritis in biological joints, affecting the range and fluidity of movement.

This project aims to:

- Create a realistic model of a robotic leg structure.
- Implement joint constraints and movement limitations to simulate arthritis.
- Use advanced tools and techniques in Cinema 4D to enhance the realism of the simulation.
- Provide a step-by-step guide to facilitate the design process for beginners and advanced users alike.
- The following steps guide you through setting up your environment, creating and naming the project, and designing the robotic leg with specified constraints and enhancements.

## Technologies Used 🔧
- **Maxon Cinema 4D**: A powerful 3D modeling, animation, and rendering application used for creating the robot leg design.

## Steps to Complete 🗺️

1. **Create an Account in Maxon**:
    - Go to the Maxon website and create a new account.

2. **Download Cinema 4D**:
    - After creating your account, download Cinema 4D from the Maxon website.

3. **Create a New Project**:
    - Open Cinema 4D and create a new project named `task1.c4d`.

   

4. **Begin Designing the Arthritis Mechanism**:
    - Use the tools and features in Cinema 4D to start designing the arthritis of robot legs.

5. **Use Leg Structure**:
    - In Cinema 4D, go to `Character > Skinning > Joint` to add joints to the leg structure.
  - Add four main joints: `Foot`, `Ankle`, `Knee`, and `Thigh`.

6. **Add Plane Tool to Set as Floor**:
    - Use the Plane tool to create a floor at a 0-degree angle and name it `guide`. This will act as the ground for your robot leg design.

   

7. **Add "Logo Screen" and "Lighting" Folders**:

    - Create a folder named `Logo Screen` to organize elements related to scene capturing and setup. Inside this folder, add an `RS Camera` to manage camera settings and viewpoints effectively.
    - Create a folder named `Lighting` to organize lighting elements within the scene. Inside this folder, add an `RS Dome Light` to ensure proper illumination and ambiance.


8. **Add Null Object in Each Leg**:
    - Add a null object to each leg, labeling them as `Right` and `Left`.

   

9. **Add IK-Spline to Each Joint**:
    - Add the tool named `IK-spline` to each joint to improve the movement of each leg.
